//INSTRUCTIONS:
//When you create any mod by creating a directory inside Steam, 
//certain files will automatically copy over, including this 
//file when you run the game. If you want to replace or add any
//strings, place them in this file and when the mod is enabled, 
//these strings will also be added. The english string file is 
//a global fallback when a string cannot be found in the 
//desired native language file.
//
//If you would like to modify an existing string, copy only
//the strings you wish to modify into this file, and do not
//delete them from the original file.
